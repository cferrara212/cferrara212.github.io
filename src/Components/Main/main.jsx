                    <p className='tab'>     I am a full stack developer that loves programming. I have always loved computers, 
                        and have managed networks in the US Army. I love development because it feels as 
                        if the learning is limitless, and it allows me to exercise my passion for creativity. 
                        I am a quick learner and love learning and improving my skills, and programming allows 
                        me to do that every single day.
                        <br/><br/>
                       My life experiences have given me a drive, a passion, and a propensity for thought that 
                       has led me to be a top performer at everything I do. I excel quickly, because anything I do, 
                       is done with drive. When I was young, I had an artistic passion for everything that I did, but 
                       it wasnâ€™t until I became a network administrator in the military that I received the discipline 
                       and logic to really create a positive flow and drive. From here, I began entrepreneurial 
                       endeavors that taxed my critical thinking, and taught me how to have humility in all that I do.
                       My problem solving abilities, combined with the humility to know when to ask for help make me an
                       excellent team mate.</p>
